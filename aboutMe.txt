Hi! I'm Athanogs, a passionate Computer Science student on a journey to become a well-rounded software engineer.
I enjoy exploring new technologies, solving real-world problems through code, and building projects that make an impact.
This GitHub is where I share my learning, university work, and personal experiments in programming and software development.

Let's build something awesome!
