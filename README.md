## 🧠 What I Do

- 🛡️ Design and secure network infrastructures (on-premises and cloud)
- 🔍 Analyze and forward logs to SIEMs like Splunk and ELK
- ⚙️ Automate basic incident response workflows with TheHive and Cortex
- 🌐 Harden Linux/Windows systems and deploy IDS/IPS with Suricata
- 📦 Build labs to simulate real-world attack and defense scenarios
- 🐍 Develop cybersecurity tools and labs with Python (MAC spoofing, ARP spoofing, packet sniffers, vulnerability scanners)

## 📚 What I'm Building Here

🚀 A full practical cybersecurity lab environment simulating real SOC operations (Splunk, ELK, TheHive, Cortex, MISP).

🔍 Threat detection and hunting scenarios using real logs from web servers, firewalls, and Windows servers.

🧰 Python-based cybersecurity tools and scripts for network scanning, spoofing, sniffing, and basic red teaming.

☁️ Demonstrations of cloud security practices (Azure) with a focus on real-world threat mitigation.

📘 An open portfolio showcasing practical skills in network defense, SIEM management, cloud security, and ethical hacking.

🛡️ My goal is to document real, practical projects that reflect the skills needed to operate, defend, and monitor complex environments — preparing for professional roles in SOC and Cloud Security.
